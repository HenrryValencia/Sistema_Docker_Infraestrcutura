Frontend (React)

This is a minimal component `Ventas.jsx` that expects the backend API to be proxied to `/` (e.g. via a dev server or nginx).

Install dependencies (if you scaffolded with Vite/CRA adapt accordingly):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Then import `Ventas.jsx` in your app and render it.
